5. **Enable Push Notifications**

   - Tap "Allow" to enable push notifications for new communications requests
   - You can also enable/disable notifications later using the toggle in the app header

## Benefits of Installing as a Web App

- **Home Screen Access**: Quick access from your iPhone's home screen
- **Full-Screen Experience**: No browser address bar or navigation controls
- **Push Notifications**: Receive alerts when new communications requests are submitted
- **Offline Support**: Basic functionality works even without an internet connection
- **App-Like Experience**: Feels like a native app with smooth transitions

## Notes for iPhone 13 Pro

The app has been optimized for your iPhone 13 Pro's screen size, with custom splash screens and proper status bar integration. The blue theme color will extend to the status bar when using the app.

## Troubleshooting

If you don't receive push notifications:

1. Check your iPhone's notification settings (Settings > Notifications > SH Comms)
2. Ensure the notification toggle is enabled in the app
3. Try restarting the app by closing it completely and reopening
4. Make sure you're launching the app from the home screen icon, not from Safari
